# Help
Here are some tips, solutions to common problems, and guides for testing.

## Tips

### Use default settings
One of the goals of Password Helper is to ensure that best practices are followed when working with passwords. By 
default, this library follows password handling best practices. If you use this library with the default settings you 
will be secure *by default*. (This does not include how you store and transmit that data, of course).

## Asking for help on Stack Overflow
Be sure when you [ask a question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask?tags=php,password) pertaining to the 
usage of this library be sure to tag your question with the **PHP** and **password** tags. Make sure you follow their
[guide for asking a good question](http://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask) as poorly asked questions will be closed, 
and I will not be able to assist you.

A good question will include all the following:
- A description of the problem (what are you trying to do? what results are you expecting? what results are you actually getting?)
- The code you are using (only post the relevant code)
- Any error message(s) you are getting

**Do not use Stack Overflow to report bugs.** Bugs may be reported [here](https://github.com/stymiee/password-helper/issues/new).
